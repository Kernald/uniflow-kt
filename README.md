# UniFlow ðŸ¦„ - Unidirectional Data Flow for Android, using Kotlin coroutines

## What is Unidirectional Data Flow?

Unidirectional Data Flow is a concept that means that data has one, and only one, way to be transferred to other parts of the application.

This means that:

- state is passed to the view
- actions are triggered by the view
- actions can update the state
- the state change is passed to the view

The view is a result of the application state. State can only change when actions happen. When actions happen, the state is updated.

Thanks to one-way bindings, data cannot flow in the opposite way (as would happen with two-way bindings, for example), and this has some key advantages:

itâ€™s less error prone, as you have more control over your data
itâ€™s easier to debug, as you know what is coming from where

## Why UniFlowðŸ¦„?

UniFlow help you write your app with states and events to ensure consistency through the time, and this with Coroutines.

UniFlow provides:

* Smart way to write a Data flow in pure Kotlin
* Android extensions to let you just focus on States & Events
* Ready for Kotlin coroutines
* Easy to test

## Setup

#### Current version is `0.6.2`

Choose one of the following dependency:

```gradle
// Android
implementation 'io.uniflow:uniflow-android:$version'
testImplementation 'io.uniflow:uniflow-android-test:$version'

// AndroidX
implementation 'io.uniflow:uniflow-androidx:$version'
testImplementation 'io.uniflow:uniflow-androidx-test:$version'
```

this version is based on Kotlin `1.3.50` & Coroutines `1.3.0`

## Quick intro

### Writing your first UI state

Describe your data flow states with `UIState`:

```kotlin
data class WeatherState(val day : String, val temperature : String) : UIState()
```

Publish state updates from your ViewModel:

```kotlin
class WeatherDataFlow(val repo : WeatherRepository) : AndroidDataFlow() {

    fun getWeather() = setState {
        // call to get data
        val weather = repo.getWeatherForToday().await()
        // return a new state
        WeatherState(weather.day, weather.temperature)
    }
}
```

Observe your state flow from your Activity or Fragment:

```kotlin
class WeatherActivity : AppCompatActivity {

	val weatherFlow : WeatherDataFlow ... // ViewModel created with Koin for example :)
	
		override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {		
		
		// Observe incoming states
		onStates(weatherFlow) { state ->
			when (state) {
				// react on WeatherState update
				is WeatherState -> showWeather(state)
			}
		}
	}
}

```

### Easy testing!

Create your ViewModel instance and mock your states observer:

```kotlin
val mockedRepo : WeatherRepository = mockk(relaxed = true)
lateinit var dataFlow : WeatherDataFlow

@Before
fun before() {
	// create WeatherDataFlow instance with mocked WeatherRepository
	dataFlow = WeatherDataFlow(mockedRepo)
	// create mocked observer
	view = detailViewModel.mockObservers()
}
```

Now you can test incoming states with `hasState`. We are providing Mockk to help mock underlying coroutines call: 

```kotlin
@Test
fun `has some weather`() {
	// prepare test data
	val weatherData = WeatherData(...)
	// setup mocked call
	coEvery { mockedRepo.getWeatherForToday() } return weatherData
		
	// Call getWeather()
	dataFlow.getWeather()
		
	// verify state
	verifySequence {
	    view.hasState(WeatherState(weatherData.day, weatherData.temperature))
	}
}
```

## Actions & events

## Ready for coroutines

Threading primitives

## FlowResult: smart fucntional coroutines

## More test tools

SetState help you register a new state:

```kotlin
// update the current state
fun getDetail() = setState{
        // return directly your state object
        WeatherState(...)
    }
```


FromState help you register a state if you are in the given state, else send BadOrWrongState event:

```kotlin
// Execute this state update only if current state is in WeatherListState
fun loadNewLocation(location: String) = fromState<WeatherListState>{ currentState ->
        // currentState is WeatherListState
        // ...
    }
```

For more side effects actions, you can use `UIEvent` and avoid update the current state with `withState`:

```kotlin
fun getDetail() = withState {
        // won't update the current state
    }
```


## Trigger also Events

For fire and forget side effects/events, define some events with `UIEvent`:

```kotlin
// Events definition
sealed class WeatherEvent : UIEvent() {
    data class Success(val location: String) : WeatherEvent()
    data class Failed(val location: String, val error: Throwable? = null) : WeatherEvent()
}
```

From your Data Flow VIewModel, trigger events with `sendEvent()`:

```kotlin
class WeatherListViewModel(
        private val getCurrentWeather: GetCurrentWeather,
        private val getWeatherForLocation: GetWeatherForGivenLocation
) : AndroidDataFlow() {


    fun loadNewLocation(location: String) = fromState<WeatherListState> (
            {
                // send event
                sendEvent(WeatherEvent.Success(location))

            },
            { error ->
                // on error send event
                sendEvent(WeatherEvent.Failed(location,error))
            })
}

```

_note_: sendEvent() return a null state (UIState?). Can help write

Observe events from your ViewModel with `onEvent`:

```kotlin
onEvents(viewModel) { event ->
    when (val data = event.take()) {
        is WeatherListUIEvent.Success -> showSuccess(data.location)
        is WeatherListUIEvent.Failed -> showFailed(data.location, data.error)
    }
}
```

On an event, you can either `take()` or `peek()` its data:

- `take` - consume the event data, can't be taken by other event consumer
- `peek` - peek the event's data, even if the data has been consumed


## Clean Error Handling


Each action allow you to provide an error handling function. You can also catch any error more globally:


```kotlin
class WeatherViewModelFlow : AndroidDataFlow() {

    init {
        // init state as Loading
        setState { UIState.Loading }
    }

    fun getMyWeather(val day : String) = setState(
        { lastState ->
            // Background call
            val weather = getWeatherForDay(day).await()
            // return state to UI
            WeatherState(weather)
        },
        { error -> // get error here })

    // Unhandled errors here
    override suspend fun onError(error: Throwable){
        // ...
    }

}
```

## Scheduling & Testing

First don't forget to use thr following rule:

```kotlin
@get:Rule
var rule = TestDispatchersRule()
```

`TestDispatchersRule` allow you to dispatch with `Unconfined` thread, as we flatten all scheduling to help sequential running of all states & events.

You can also use the `TestThreadRule`, to emulate a main thread: replace main dispatcher by a single thread context dispatcher

## Easy testing with Mockk

also check incoming events with `hasEvents`:

```kotlin
@Test
fun testGetLastWeather() {
    detailViewModel.getDetail()

    verifySequence {
        view.hasEventWeatherListUIEvent.Success)
    }
}
